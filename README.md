THIS WAS A COLLEGE PROJECT.

## Program

It is a very pure demonstration of Floyd's algorithm to find the shortest path from every node in a graph to any other.

## Usage

Run the generator to create a .txt file that contains a matrix that describes a graph.
I don't remember the exact possible combinations, but it can accept up to four arguments, in this order: -h for help, -t to activate a log, the path of the input file and the path of the output file. The input file is required.
